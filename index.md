HELLO WORLD !!!



The *Shang writing system* was made of _characters or symbols_, much like the **Egyptian system**. Animal bones and shells called __oracle bones__ held the earliest writings. 
A _diviner_ was often visited by Shang kings. It was believed that this person would help them *speak to the gods*. They would **touch hot metal sticks to bones** and __shells and the king would read the cracks to find the answer__.
